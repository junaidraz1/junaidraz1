# 👋 Hey there, I'm Muhammad Junaid Raza!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! 🎉 If you’re looking for a developer who writes **clean** code (that sometimes even works), then you've hit the jackpot. 💥

## 👨‍💻 Who am I?
I'm a **developer, data enthusiast, and full-time health tech nerd** currently studying at the **University of Turku**. 🇫🇮 As a **UTU International Student Ambassador**, I juggle tech, studies, and promoting my uni – because why settle for just one thing when you can stress about them all? 😅

## 🌱 What am I up to?
I'm deep into exploring the fascinating world of **health technology**, with a special focus on:
- **Acquisition and analysis of biosignals** – Yes, I speak fluent EEG and ECG. 🧠
- **Programming health wearables** – Making sure those step counters don't lie about how lazy I am. 🚶‍♂️
- **Deep learning** – Pretending I understand neurons, but hey, the machines don’t seem to notice. 🤖

## 🔍 Data Analytics
I have a growing passion for **data analytics** – from **cleaning messy datasets** (because apparently, nothing comes tidy in life) to **analyzing patterns that make you go "hmm."** 📊 I’m all about transforming raw data into actionable insights, or at the very least, pretty charts. 🎨

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- 🛠️ I can build Android apps that don’t crash (most of the time).
- 🧠 I’m not saying I’m a genius, but I can spell "JavaScript" without looking it up. 🤓
- 🎓 Full-time student studying **Health Tech** – because who doesn’t love endless assignments, right?
- 🍽️ Can cook a meal that’s *almost* edible. (I mean, it’s 100% edible, but the taste... well, that's subjective.)

## 🤝 Let's Connect
- 💬 Open to collaborations, but please – no “can you build my entire app for free?” requests. I already have enough stress, thanks. 😅
- 🔥 Available for part-time work, internships, or just to chat about tech, health tech, or life.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Kotlin, Java, Python, Android development** – because I believe in having a *complicated* relationship with multiple languages. 💔
- **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analytics** – pretending I know what I’m doing, but the models say otherwise. 🤓
- Comfortable with **biosignal processing**, **health wearables programming**, and diving into datasets that make others cry. 😬
